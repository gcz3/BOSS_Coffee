# Digital Media Project 

## Purpose: 
While we spend a lot of time learning about Japan and East Asia in general, we less frequently have the chance to reflect on the role that media plays in our understanding of the globe.  The purpose of this project is to give students an opportunity to reflect on how media is produced in order to develop a deeper appreciation for the construction of material we consume on a regular basis.  This project invites you to learn by doing.

## Project:
I decided to make a website showcasing a Japanse canned coffee brand known as BOSS Coffee.
